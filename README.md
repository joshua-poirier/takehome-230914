### Demo
A quick demo problem I threw together to help setup my virtual environment to solve the
questions.

### Question 1
Text answer (no solution here).

### Question 2
You have a number of items to be packaged into large packages and small packages. You
have a given number of large packages available, and a given number of small packages
available. If the available packages cannot hold all of the items, return `-1`.

Large packages can hold 5 items (no more, no less), and small packages can hold 1 item
(no more, no less). What is the minimum number of packages (large + small) needed to
hold the given items?

If you have 16 items to be packages with 2 large packages and 10 small packages
available - the minimum number of packages will be `8` (2 large + 6 small).
